# Traffic-Sign-Detection-and-Classification-Under-Challenging-Conditions

# Detect_Condtion 
This folder contains the codes to detect and solve different conditions like Lens Blurring, Extreme Darkness, Extreme Brightness and Gaussian Noise. 

# Operations on Video
The codes present in the detect_condition folder performs operation on frames, so this folder contains the code to divide the videos into frames and after the processing is done the frames need to be transformed back into video sequence.

# Optical Flow
This folder contains the code to perform detection and tracking in a video sequence. It saves the contours detected which is then passed through LeNet for recognition of traffic sign.
